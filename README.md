### 22/10/2023

The goal of this assignment is to develop a Python 3 program that automates the deployment and management of public-facing web servers in the Amazon cloud. The program will:

 - Provision an EC2 instance to host a web server.
 - Configure and launch the web server automatically.
 - Set up an S3 bucket to serve static content.
 - Monitor the serverâ€™s status and performance.

This automation will streamline the process of setting up and maintaining cloud-based web services using AWS.
